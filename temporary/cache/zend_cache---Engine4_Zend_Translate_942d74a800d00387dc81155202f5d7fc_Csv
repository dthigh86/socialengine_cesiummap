information about your ThreatForward products or account, such as important safety information
or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The full name you provide is associated with your

information about your ThreatForward products or account or material changes to this Privacy
Policy.</p>
  <p class="space"><b>(c)</b> For EU citizens, if you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from

bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from ThreatForward are
based on the preferences you provide in your ThreatForward account, the locale indicated by
your Internet Protocol (IP) address and any subscriptions included in your ThreatForward
account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is ThreatForward’s legitimate
interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting
which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email
to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.</p>
<p class="space"><b>(d)</b> ThreatForward also processes your email address to associate it with your ThreatForward account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.</p>

do not collect or store such information, though we may receive summary information about

<h2 class="space3x">PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS:</h2>
 <p class="space2x">The legal ground for processing this data for these purposes is performance of a contract. We also process your personal data as part of our fraud detection processes. The legal ground for processing your personal data for that purpose is our legitimate interest in protecting
ThreatForward and our customers from attempts to engage in fraudulent transactions.</p>

 <p class="space2x">You may choose to publicly disclose personal information about yourself and others in the
course of (i) contributing user generated content (for instance articles, blogs, surveys, reviews,

rooms, (iii) creating user profiles for public view, or (iv) posting images, photos, or videos. Be

<h2 class="space3x">OTHER DISCLOSURES:</h2>
 <p class="space2x">We may disclose personal data about you to others: <b>(a)</b> if we have your valid consent to do so;

obligation; <b>(c)</b> to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; or (d) as necessary to pursue available legal remedies or defend legal claims.</p>
<h2 class="space2x">Information Security</h2>
 <p class="space">We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. Neither
ThreatForward, nor its affiliates, nor any of their respective employees, officers or agents or the
provider of the internet services on behalf of ThreatForward (nor any other person involved in
the management or establishment of the Service) can give any representation or warranty as to
the absolute security of the data transmitted using the Service, and cannot give any guarantee that
such data will not be compromised by bad actors. If you choose to provide data to or allow
collection of data by ThreatForward, then you do so understanding the aforementioned risk.</p>

relating to your use of the Website. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to
notify you electronically by posting a notice on the website or sending an email to you. You may
have a legal right to receive this notice by mail.</p>
<h2 class="space2x">Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
 <p class="space">To help analyze how you and other visitors navigate the ThreatForward websites, we compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates to help diagnose any problems with ThreatForward’s servers, administer the ThreatForward websites, and maintain user experience
continuity across website pages and site visits, we, with assistance from third-party analytics
service providers, collect certain information when you visit our site. This information includes
IP address, geographic location of the device, browser type, browser language, date and time of
your request, time(s) of your visit(s), page views and page elements (e.g., links) that you click.
We may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other similar tools on our sites or in
our email messages to assist us in collecting and analyzing such information. We use this
information to provide better, more relevant content on our sites, to identify and fix problems,
and to improve your overall experience on our sites.</p>
<p class="space">If you do not want information collected through the use of these technologies, there is a simple
procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline many of these technologies,
or to be given the choice of declining or accepting them.</p>
<p class="space">If you reside in the European Union or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent
to use cookies on our sites, then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences
on the sites; except that certain cookies are required to enable core site functionality, and you
cannot choose to disable those cookies.</p>

 <p class="space">We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission. Note that we
may use your name, usage history and email address without further consent for non-marketing
or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major updates, customer service needs, tips
on using the website, notifications of unused features of the website, or items for which you have
requested communication).</p>
<h2 class="space2x">Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
 <p class="space">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as we add new products and apps, as we improve our current offerings and as technologies and laws change. Any changes will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

We may, additionally, alter the design and specification of the site at any time. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the website at any time without prior notice at our sole discretion.</p>
   <h2 class="space2x">Termination</h2>
   <p class="space">ThreatForward reserves the right, to the fullest extent permitted by law, at any time, without liability or refund of payment, to close your subscription, in the event of (i) your actual or reasonably suspected breach of these Terms and Conditions, (ii) ThreatForward’s decision to cease offering to its customers the subscription in its then current format, or (iii) any similar business reason which ThreatForward in its sole discretion deems to be a reasonable cause to end your subscription.</p>
   <h2 class="space3x">Moderation</h2>
   <p class="space">We have the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to
postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags,

measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.</p>

against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this

representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of us will in no circumstance be
liable as a result of any representation that we, our representatives or anyone else on behalf of us
would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU
violation. For the purpose of clarity, the opinions, statements, comments, posts and other
communications expressed on our sites and services are solely those of the poster and not ours,
